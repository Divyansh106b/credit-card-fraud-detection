# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit card fraud detection using machine learning on Kaggle dataset
## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Streamlit Web Application
   A Streamlit-based web application was also developed for this project to demonstrate how the trained machine learning model can be used in an interactive environment.
  
  The application allows users to input transaction details and receive a prediction indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
  This helped me understand how machine learning models can be integrated into simple web applications.
  
## Credits
This was my first machine learning project.

This project is based on a tutorial by AI with Noor.

I followed the tutorial step-by-step to deepen my understanding of the concepts involved in this machine learning project. All rights to the original content belong to the creator.

Completing this project helped me reinforce my learning by applying the concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit card fraud detection using machine learning on Kaggle dataset

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


  
## Credits
This was my first machine learning project.

This project is based on a tutorial by AI with Noor.

I followed the tutorial step-by-step to deepen my understanding of the concepts involved in this machine learning project. All rights to the original content belong to the creator.

Completing this project helped me reinforce my learning by applying the concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

## 🚀 Deployment
The project has also been deployed using **Streamlit** to create an interactive web application.  
The Streamlit app allows users to input transaction details and check whether a transaction is predicted as **Legitimate** or **Fraudulent**.
